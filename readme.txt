This is a colour flipper website written by me, inspired by the tutorial by freeCodeCamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4 .

The only code I replicated from the tutorial are JavaScript functions for HTML and Hex colors, but I understand them.

Everything else is my own work, including the RGB site along with its JavaScript.
